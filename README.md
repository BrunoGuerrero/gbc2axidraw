# gbc2axidraw
Destined to convert a low-palette image into a set an SVG ready for the AxiDraw.

Converts each pixel into a shape (Square, circle or cross), with each pixels grouped by color in layers numbered for use in AxiDraw.
Squares and Circles still require hatch fill for filling out the shapes. 

Initially built to convert GameBoy Camera images to AxiDraw.
